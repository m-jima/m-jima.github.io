      <p> The Game of Gale, otherwise known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_switching_game"> Shannon switching game</a>, is a two-player connection game invented by American mathematician Claude Shannon. The most commonly played version of the game is played on a rectangular grid (as opposed to an arbitrary graph), invented by American mathematician David Gale in the 1950's.</p>
